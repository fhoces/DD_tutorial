## Dynamic Documents for computational reproducibility
- Based on principles of *literate programming* aims at combining code and paper in one single document 
- Best framework to achieve the holy grail of **one-click reproducible workflow**
- Best two current implementations: `RMarkdown (R)` & `Jupyter (Python)`. `Stata` is cathching up (more the end)

## Currently code and narrative components live in separate universes

## Dynamic Documents: integrate the two universes!

## Dynamic Documents: A Reciepe  

- 1 simple language that can combine text and code: `Markdown` 
- 1 statistical package to do the analysis (`R`, `Python`, `3S's?`)
- 1 machinery to combine analysis and text to create a single output: `Pandoc`
- [Optional-but-not-really] 1 program to bring all the elements together: RStudio/RMarkdown, Jupyter



## For our excercise: R Markdown  

- `R`: **open source** programming language design for statistical analysis.   
- RStudio: free software that provides and Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE)  
- RStudio combines all together R + Markdown + Pandoc to produce multiple outputs

summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
